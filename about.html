                <h4>1) Corpoarte Social Responsibility</h4>
                <p>
                    The environment pillar appreciates the role that Mother Nature plays
                    in providing us with this treasure called environment.
                    We appreciate the impact our business makes in the course of our day

                </p>
                <h4> 2)Environmental Policy</h4>
                <p>
                    Environmental awareness and preservation are becoming increasingly
                    important elements of the working environment. For many years workplaces
                    have let their waste management and environmental responsibilities take
                    a back seat however, Tanji has prided itself on not being one of the many and is pleased to work 
                    with clients who share the company’s concern in protecting the environment and saving energy.
